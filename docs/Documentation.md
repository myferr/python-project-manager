Replace `{GITHUB-REPO-URL}` with the URL/link of the GitHub repo you want to clone.
> `gh-clone` requires Git
### *ARG:* Get

You use `get` just like `pip install`. `get` is used for downloading Python packages/modules via *[Python Pip](https://pypi.org/)*. To use `get` run the following command: `python ppm.py get {PACKAGE/MODULE NAME}`

Replace `{PACKAGE/MODULE NAME}` with the Python package/module name you want to download.

There are three project types.

* `github-project`
* `personal-project`

When you select a project type PPM creates the project files and folders that your project type needs.

### How to select project type

To select your project type, run the command to enter the setup menu `python ppm.py setup`
after that you can use your up and down arrow keys ( `^`  `V`) to navigate which project type to choose.

Press enter to select the project type.

### Project files.

**`default` Project Files:**
* `src` - folder
* `main.py` - file (located in `src`)

**`github-project` Project Files:**
* `src` - folder
* `main.py` - file (located in `src`)
* `project.toml` - file
* `.gitignore` - file
* `README.md` - file
